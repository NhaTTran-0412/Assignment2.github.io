        <h2>3.Project Ideas</h2>
        <ol><h3><li>Overview:</li></h3>
        <p3.1><ol>PixelMarket is a website project devised for commercial purposes. All activities of the PixelMarket project are based on the legality of the law. This project is developed with the aim of allowing users to share and selling legal photographic works or digital paintings. In addition, this website also works as a photography forum for photographers, where they can share their knowledge and tips in the photography industry.</ol></p3.1>
        <h3><li>Motivation:</li></h3>
        <p3.2><ol>With the proliferation of smartphones and the internet, people no longer focus on how to take a good photo, they just need to download a photo they consider to be beautiful without paying any fee, that makes the photographer not yet well paid. Photographs are valuable and should be paid well for others to own. The idea of an online photo marketplace came to me when I first started learning about photography and realized this fact. I hope that the project can help photography enthusiasts have a small income as well as motivate them to continue pursuing their passion in the field.</ol></p3.2>
        <h3><li>Description:</li></h3>
        <p3.3><ol>PixelMarket website project consists of 2 main pages which are sales page and forum. On any page, the user is required to create an account and it can be used for both sites. On the sales page, the products for sale will appear in the center of the site and the topic filtering feature will be placed to the right to help users select and search faster. The site also offers a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly achievement catalog, and is constantly updating the rewards to dynamically create content for users. Each user is also provided with the feature to post their products, they will need to follow the order such as choosing the product, describing the product, choosing the topic, choosing the desired price and accepting the terms. Web's. To buy any photo, users just need to select the photo and click on the item add to cart and pay. All payments will be made via PayPal, Visa or MasterCard. Users can also comment and rate on products they have just purchased. In addition, the website also automatically deducted 20% of the image's money in each transaction to maintain the website. On the forum page, the website will have main sections such as News, Tutorials, Tips, Discussions and so on. This is an open forum so each section has its own user-contributed topics. Forums will sometimes create open topics for people to debate together. Moreover, the forum will also automatically select topics with lots of interaction in the proposal so that it can reach all members of the forum.</ol></p3.3>
        <h3><li>Tools and Technologies: </li></h3>
        <p3.4><ol>To create this website, Visual Studio Code is used as the most basic Integrated development environment (IDE) for web development and I also use Adobe Illustrator to design User Interface (UI). In terms of hardware, I will need a server to be able to store data and run websites.</ol></p3.4>
        <h3><li>Skills required: </li></h3>
        <p3.5><ol>Programming with languages like Javascript, CSS, C # or HTML is a necessary first skill to develop a project. Next, work with Adobe Illustrator skills and improve the skills of User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI). I also need to have server knowledge to operate and update the website</ol></p3.5>
        <h3><li>Outcome: </li></h3>
        <p3.6><ol>My project will benefit both developers and users, especially photographers. It is profitable and contributes to maintain the passion of many people in the field of photography. My project gives both amateur and professional photographers the opportunity to sell their work and receive profits for their efforts. In addition, I hope the project forum helps many people to improve and learn a lot from experienced people.</ol></p3.6></ol>
        <h2>4. Feedback</h2>
        <ol><p4>I have received feedback from 2 friends about my project idea.
            <br><ol>Hieu said that my project is innovative but as a general feature, it does not have many exclusive functions. I admit his feedback is correct, I want my project to be as handy as possible and to make the newcomers more accessible. In addition, in the future I can also update to add many new features if they are useful to users.</ol>
            <br><ol>As for Binh's feedback, he said that I should only focus on one main website and the forum is not necessary, adding a forum page will increase unnecessary work. In my opinion, to be able to attract users, we need to create an environment for users to stay longer and at the same time the forum can support the sales page to increase profit.</ol>
            <br>Thanks to the feedback above, they have helped me shape what I do in the future with my project as well as plan more carefully for my upcoming plans.

        <h2>5. IT Techonologies</h2>
        <ol><h3><li> Cloud computing</li></h3>
        <p5.1><ol><b>What does it do ?</b> Cloud computing is the first mentioned phrase since the 1960s. Today, the development of cloud computing has created tremendous potential in the field of cloud storage and streaming. Cloud computing appears largely in internet services today such as cloud storage with brands like Google Drive, One Drive or cloud gaming services like Google Stadia, PlayStation Now.

We see a very future world</ol>

            <br><ol><b>What is the likely impact ?</b> The potential of cloud computing is enormous, however, many adverse issues still exist such as privacy, cybercrime and information theft. In the future, the popularity of cloud computing services will gradually replace the traditional storage method of electronic devices, cloud rental services will grow and occupy a large part in the field of storage. it will change the way we think about how to store it. With cloud computing technology, future electronic devices may be smaller because there are no more traditional methods of storage via disk. This development threatens the hard drive business for individual users or businesses, which directly affects the corporations that manufacture storage hardware.</ol>
            
            <br><ol><b>How will this affect you ?</b> Cloud computing will change the way I store information every day and cloud service fees will take up the majority of my monthly money.

        <h3><li>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</li></h3>  
        <p5.2><ol><b>What does it do ?</b> Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence expressed mechanically, as opposed to natural human intelligence. Machine learning is an AI feature that allows professionals to train AI so that it can recognize and predict data. AI is currently the trend of technology development globally. Currently, AI is present in many areas of life such as healthcare, education, business and manufacturing. In the future, it will be used more in life or in any way, AI in the future will be confirmed by scientists that can operate without human supervision. The evolution of the internet of things (IoT) has also contributed to making AI more viable in our daily lives, for example, the intellingent vacuum cleaner robot, which has floor sweeping functionality and the use of machine learning to work optimization.</ol>

            <br><ol><b>What is the likely impact ?</b> The potential of AI is undisputed, it brings a lot of benefits to humans, it helps people live more convenient lives and increases work productivity. With AI and machine learning, the devices around us can become automated, make relevant recommendations through machine learning, many people think this will have a negative impact on humans because we will be dependent on them almost entirely. The development of AI affects a lot of industries in society, with automation through AI the majority of occupations with physical activity will be replaced by machines and AI, who directly affect. are workers because the work will require less labor and cause a labor surplus.</ol>
